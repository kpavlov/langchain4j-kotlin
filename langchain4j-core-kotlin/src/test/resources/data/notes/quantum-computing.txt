Quantum computing is a type of computing that uses tiny particles called "qubits," which are different from the bits used in regular computers. Regular computers use bits that can either be a 0 or a 1, like light switches being on or off. Quantum computers, however, use qubits, which can be both 0 and 1 at the same time! This special property is called "superposition." It means quantum computers can handle more information at once, making them faster at solving certain kinds of problems.

Another important thing in quantum computing is "entanglement." When qubits get entangled, the state of one qubit is connected to the state of another, even if they are far apart. This allows quantum computers to process information in a way that regular computers can't. These features make quantum computers potentially much more powerful, but they are still in the early stages, and scientists are working hard to figure out how to use them for real-world problems.
